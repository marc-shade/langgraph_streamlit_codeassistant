## Setup and Usage

### Python Dependency Installation

Before running the application, ensure you have configured the necessary API keys in the `.env` file located at the root of the project directory. You will need to set your E2B API key in your local environment. Follow these steps for Python dependency installation:

1. Create a virtual environment by running:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   This command creates a new directory named `venv` in your project directory, which will contain the Python executable and libraries.

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows, run:
     ```cmd
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux, run:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   After activation, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.

3. With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages by running:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all the listed packages along with their dependencies.

Remember to activate the virtual environment (`venv`) every time you work on this project. To deactivate the virtual environment and return to your global Python environment, simply run `deactivate`.

### Node.js Package Installation and Build

After setting up the Python environment, proceed with the Node.js setup:

1. Install the required Node.js packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the packages:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

### Starting the Application

Finally, to start the application:

1. Launch the Streamlit application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. Access the application via your web browser to start interacting with the AI assistant.

Note: The application automatically initiates the React development server in a subprocess, eliminating the need to manually run `npm start`.

## Important Note

This application combines advanced AI capabilities with code execution. Always review and understand any code before execution, particularly in production environments.
